The purpose of this project is to analyize over 1.5 million tweets with either the #JoeBiden or #Trump tag in the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election. 

This is a two step project with the first program simply classifying the posts. 

  The first program is fundamentally extremely simple, looking for positive or negative keywords to describe the electoral canidate and then assigning points based on which canidate was supported.
  
  The program allocates 1 point for positive or negative adjectives and 2 points for positive or negative hashtags, this is becuase a hashtag is a clearer indicator than simply a keyword

  The second program then evaluates the total points per tweet per user, and finds whether or not the user's scores differ over tweets. This is to see whether or not the user is polarized specifically towards one politcal faction over another. A user that consitently scores high republican scores compared to democrat scores accros tweets would be an example of a polarized user. The percentage of polarized users will then be outputted and a final conclusion will be drawn as to the levels of polarization that existed in twitter users preceeding the 2020 US presidential elections
